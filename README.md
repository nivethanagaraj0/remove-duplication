# remove-duplication
Removing duplicate is the process of eliminating duplicates entries or rows from dataset. This is essential in the data analysis and data preprocessing task because duplicate values can skew result and lead to inaccurate conclusions.
By identifying and removing duplicates, you ensure data integrity and maintain the accuracy of your analyses.

The process typically involves loading the dataset, checking for duplicates, viewing them if needed, and finally, eliminating the duplicate entries using appropriate methods or functions. The aim is to have a clean dataset with unique records, facilitating more accurate and reliable data analysis.

When implementing this process in programming languages like Python, pandas is commonly used for its simplicity and efficiency. The `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()` methods in pandas are particularly helpful for identifying and removing duplicates, respectively.

In summary, removing duplication is a crucial step in data preparation to ensure the quality and accuracy of your dataset before conducting further analyses or feeding it into machine learningÂ models
